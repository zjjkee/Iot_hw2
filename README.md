Homework 2
----------

1. Recall from the lectures the approximation algorithm for counting 1's over a sliding window.

2. Implement this approximation algorithm in `window-bit-count-apx/window-bit-count-apx.h`.

3. Test your implementation using `window-bit-count-apx/test.c`.

4. Keep in mind that the tests in `test.c` are not comprehensive. It is possible that the tests pass, but the implementation is incorrect.

5. Benchmark your implementation by typing `make` inside the directory `window-bit-count-plots`. You will need to download R (https://www.r-project.org/) in order to create the plots.

6. If you feel that there are certain aspects of your implementation that need explanation, you can include text in the pdf/LaTeX file that you submit. Alternatively, you can include comments in the code.

7. Your implementation **must** be as space-efficient (asymptotically) as the algorithm presented in the lectures.

8. Include the plots from benchmarking (throughput, memory) in the pdf/LaTeX file that you submit.
